* Zoomable UI
** The entire UI can be scaled (including in-world text, manipulators, etc) by a user-supplied scale value (Preferences->Graphics->UI Size)
** When running fullscreen, the additional option 'Use resolution independent scale' should ensure that the UI looks the same at all resolutions
** Additionally, changing to a resolution with a different aspect ratio than your monitor's aspect ratio should not result in any squashing or stretching of your display 
* Improved Snapshot functionality
** When taking a snapshot, the world will freeze in place and the snapshot will be previewed over the entire screen (but under UI elements)
** The camera tool will be active by default, allowing you to click and drag to move the camera around while objects/avatars/etc are frozen in place, without having to hold down ALT
** You can also change snapshot parameters (resolution, JPEG compression level) and the snapshot will update on the fly
** Any time the camera moves or a parameter is changed, the existing snapshot will 'drop' away and be replaced by a new one 
** You can also take snapshot of arbitrary resolution, up to 6000x6000 
*** Be aware that the larger the snapshot is, the more system resources are needed to create it -- you can potentially run out of memory and crash if taking very large snapshots on a low-end system
* Eyedropper tool
** Added the ability to pick colors and textures from objects in view (and that you own) inside the color picker and texture picker
** When depressed, the button changes the mouse cursor and activates a 'pipette' or 'eyedropper' tool

** Pie menus now provide a gradually faded border when the right mouse button is down to suggest that you can use them by moving the mouse in a given direction, which is faster and easier than clicking on a pie wedge directly

* Tear-off menus
** Added ability to click on a double line at the top of any menu or sub-menu and pin it in place on the UI as a 'floater'
** All of the menu items should still work, as well as branching menus, etc. 
** Closing the floater will make it disappear
** Accessing a detached menu via its parent menu will bring the floating menu to the foreground, but not reposition it

** The second column for each listing of returned search results (i.e. Dwell, Price, etc.) has its font size reduced to make additional space
* Improved text field support for INSERT key

** Attachment rotations in 'Attachment' ruler mode are relative to the attach point instead of the root of the avatar

Release Notes for Second Life 1.10.0(32) May 24, 2006
=====================================
Features:
* Hardware lighting
** Any primitive in Second Life may be turned into a light
*** Light properties are radius, color, intensity, and falloff
** New options in the Preference panel indicate the type of lighting you want to use
*** 'Sun or Moon only' is best for low-performance hardware
**** Everything in-world is lit in real time by the sun or moon only
*** 'Nearby Lights' is available for any hardware configuration
**** Everything in-world is lit by sun or moon and up to six nearby light sources
** More information about the new lighting system is available here:
*** http://forums.secondlife.com/showthread.php?t=100128

* Flexible objects
** Cube, prism and cylinder primitive types can now be made flexible as a client-side effect
** Simulation parameters for material and responsiveness to gravity and wind
** Objects that are flexible cannot be physical and are always phantom
** Use of these is currently limited to preserve framerate as they increase amount of client-side processing

* Occlusion culling
** Frame rate is improved when objects that would normally be rendered are hidden from view
** FPS will be significantly improved when inside a structure
*** Windows or other transparent surfaces will decrease effectiveness as objects in view will be rendered, whether or not they are within the structure
** Toggle with CTRL-SHIFT-o on all platforms

* New 'Click Action' functionality for objects
** Object creators can select a default left-click action for objects:
*** Touch (default), Sit, Buy, Pay, or Open
** These actions happen immediately when a resident left-clicks on the object, without a menu
** Builders set the action in the build tools 'General' panel, at the bottom
** Click actions override touch events for scripts
*** If you want the touch behavior, be sure 'touch (default)' is the click action
** You can't set 'Buy' as the action unless an object is for sale
** 'Sit' should be useful for both chairs and vehicles
** 'Open' should be useful for vendors that sell packaged objects

* Updated functionality for the Top Scripts/Top Colliders dialog
** Improvements allow Estate owners to return or disable offending objects
*** Disabling an object makes it non-physical and disables all scripts

* Classified ads now have an auto-renew option
** Checking the 'Auto renew each week' checkbox in Profile > Classifieds will cause your classified to be republished instead of expiring after one week
** You will be charged the same listing price as the initial classified
** To change the listing price, you need to make a new classified

* Universal Binary installer for Mac clients is now standard
** PowerPC and Intel Mac versions are now bundled together in one 'Universal Binary' installer
** Minimum required version for Second Life is now 10.3.9

* The Login screen now features a box to select the region to log into
** This has the same effect as using a SLURL to log into a region


New LSL functions:

* llHTTPRequest
** Added new LSL call & event to support HTTP access from external scripts
** LSL Function usage:
*** key llHTTPRequest(string <url>, list <parameters>, string <body>)
**** Send HTTP request to <url> with <parameters> and <body>, returning key uniquely identifying the request
**** Currently, the only supported parameter is the following key/value pair: HTTP_METHOD, <method name>
** LSL Event usage:
*** http_response(key <request_id>, integer <status>, list <metadata>, string <body>)
**** Called when a pending HTTP request <request_id> completes with the HTTP <status>, <metadata> and response <body>
**** This facility supports GET, PUT and POST methods, X-SecondLife-headers, text/* MIME types, and transcoding of body contents to LSL's Unicode strings

* llGetParcelFlags
** Get the parcel flags (PARCEL_FLAG_*) for the parcel including the point pos
** Returns an integer that is a bit field of flags
** This bitfield can be ANDed with a flag to see if that flag is set for that parcel
** Usage:
*** integer llGetParcelFlags(vector pos)
** Example:
*** if (llGetParcelFlags() & PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_CREATE_OBJECTS) llOwnerSay('You may create objects in this parcel!');
** Bitfields:
*** PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_FLY
**** Used to determine if a parcel allows flying
*** PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_SCRIPTS
**** Used to determine if a parcel allows outside scripts
*** PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_LANDMARK
**** Used to determine if a parcel allows landmarks to be created
*** PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_TERRAFORM

*** PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_DAMAGE
**** Used to determine if a parcel allows damage
*** PARCEL_FLAG_ALLOW_CREATE_OBJECTS

*** PARCEL_FLAG_USE_ACCESS_GROUP

*** PARCEL_FLAG_USE_ACCESS_LIST
**** Used to determine if a parcel limits access to a list of residents
*** PARCEL_FLAG_USE_BAN_LIST
**** Used to determine if a parcel uses a ban list
*** PARCEL_FLAG_USE_LAND_PASS_LIST
**** Used to determine if a parcel allows passes to be purchased
*** PARCEL_FLAG_LOCAL_SOUND_ONLY
