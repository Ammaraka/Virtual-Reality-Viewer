Release Notes for Second Life 1.20(10) June 9th, 2008
=====================================

New features:
* Added five texture constants for referencing in llSetLinkTexture:
** TEXTURE_BLANK is the non-transparent blank texture, equivalent to UUID "5748decc-f629-461c-9a36-a35a221fe21f"
** TEXTURE_DEFAULT is the default plywood texture, equivalent to UUID "89556747-24cb-43ed-920b-47caed15465f"
** TEXTURE_PLYWOOD is the default plywood texture, equivalent to UUID "89556747-24cb-43ed-920b-47caed15465f"
** TEXTURE_TRANSPARENT is a fully transparent texture, equivalent to UUID "8dcd4a48-2d37-4909-9f78-f7a9eb4ef903"
** TEXTURE_MEDIA is the default Media texture, equivalent to UUID "8b5fec65-8d8d-9dc5-cda8-8fdf2716e361"
** Note: TEXTURE_DEFAULT is a synonym for TEXTURE_PLYWOOD
** Compatibility Note:
*** Scripts using these constants will run smoothly in all Second Life viewers, however previous versions of the viewer will NOT be able to edit
    and recompile scripts using the new constants. Older versions will report "(XX,YY) : ERROR : Name not defined within scope" when trying to
    compile such a script.
*** If you are using an older version of the viewer that does not support the TEXTURE_ contants and want to edit and recompile scripts with a TEXTURE_ constant,
    then you have to revert to the earlier LSL requirement to use the UUID of the texture you want to use.
*** The TEXTURE_TRANSPARENT texture will be gray unless you view it with a viewer that supports this transparent texture (1.20.10 or above).

Changes:
* Watchdog is disabled in settings for final Release Candidates
* VWR-7315: "TEXTURE_DEFAULT" is a bad constant name; (this now refers to Plywood texture)

** TEXTURE_TRANSPARENT is the default "white transparent" texture, equivalent to "59facb66-4a72-40a2-815c-7d9b42c56f60"
** Note: Scripts using these constants will run smoothly in all Second Life viewers, however previous versions of the viewer will NOT be able to edit and recompile scripts using the new constants. Older versions will report "(XX,YY) : ERROR : Name not defined within scope" when trying to compile such a script.

* Thread monitoring to catch freezes:
** A new thread monitor (also referred to as a Watchdog) will detect when the viewer application frozen for a period greater than 10 seconds and possibly force a crash with detailed logs
