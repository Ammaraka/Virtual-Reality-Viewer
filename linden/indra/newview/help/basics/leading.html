There are multiple ways to move around, but first, we'll learn the basic mouse movement methods. The easiest way to move your avatar is to lead it around by pointing to where you want it to go.
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Right-click on the ground close to the avatar.</font><p>
A pie menu opens.
<P>
<font color="#000080">2. Move the cursor up and click on &quot;Go Here.&quot;</font><P> 
The avatar walks to the place where you clicked. 
<P>
<font color="#000080">3. Click on the ground far away from the avatar.</font>
<P>
<font color="#000080">4. When the pie menu opens, move the cursor up and click on &quot;Go Here.&quot;</font>
<P>
If the distance was far enough, your avatar flew to the spot.<BR>
Take some time now lead your avatar around for a while.
