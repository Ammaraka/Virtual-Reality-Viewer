The point-and-go method is fine if you know where you want to go, but if you want to just wander around, there's a better way to go.
<P>
<font color="#000080">1. Click on your avatar.</font>
<P>
<font color="#000080">2. When the pie menu opens, move the cursor up and click on &quot;Go...&quot;.</font><P>
A small box with arrows in it opens near the bottom of the screen.
<P>
<font color="#000080">3. Click (or click and hold) on all of the arrows, one at a time.</font><P>
If you play with these for a while, you'll get the hang of moving forward and backward, turning left and right, side-walking left and right, and even jumping and crouching.
<P>
Now we'll try a shortcut:
<P>
<font color="#000080">4. Click and hold on the forward arrow, then, while still holding, slide the cursor out of the box, left and right, forward and backward.</font>
<P>
Take some time and practice guiding your avatar around in this way.
<P>
<font color="#000080">5. Click on the Fly button.</font>
<P>
Your avatar rises into the air.
<P>
<font color="#000080">6. Use the arrows as before to fly around. Don't forget to try the up and down arrows.</font>
<P>
Take your time and practice a little before you move on.
<P>
<font color="#000080">7. Click on the Fly button again to return to the ground.</font>
