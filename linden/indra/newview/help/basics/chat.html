Time to learn how to chat.
<P>
The first step is to find someone to chat with.  Use the Mini Map or World Map to locate other Second Life Residents.
<P>
Once you've located someone to chat with, get only as close to then as you would to chat in real life.

Everyone within a certain range will hear you.
