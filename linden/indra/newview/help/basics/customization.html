Turn yourself into a work of art.
<P>
<font color="#000080">1. Open the Edit menu and select <font color="#B00000">Appearance...</font>.</font>
<P>
You'll see a large dialog box and a close-up of your avatar's face.
<P>
Along the left side of the dialog are a number of tabs that divide up the job into various body parts or articles of clothing.
<P>
<font color="#000080">2. Click on the <font color="#B00000">Shape tab</font> on the left.</font>
<P>
You're now ready to change your avatar's shape.
<P>
Within the Shape tab are a number of other choices: Face, Torso, Legs and Body. Plus, you can change your avatar's gender with a single click. 
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. If your avatar is male, click on female. If it's female, click on male.</font>
<P>
Your avatar will instantly change from one gender to another. The clothing will stay the same, but there will be a number of easy-to-notice changes. Go back and forth, then pick whichever one you want for now.
<P>
<font color="#000080">4. Click on the <font color="#B00000">Face</font> button.</font>
<P>
Now it's time to play.
<P>
Take your time and go through all the face sliders. Don't be afraid to giggle; you can't hurt your avatar's feelings.
<P>
Use the left- and right-arrow keys to rotate your avatar and see it from all sides as you play.
<P>
When you've finished with the face:
<P>
<font color="#000080">5. Click on the <font color="#B00000">Torso</font> button, and play with the sliders.</font>
<P>
<font color="#000080">6. Click on the <font color="#B00000">Legs</font> button, and play with the sliders.</font>
<P>
<font color="#000080">7. Click on the <font color="#B00000">Body</font> button, and play with the sliders.</font>
<P>
Once you've played with the adjustments for a while and want to keep what you've got:
<P>
<font color="#000080">8. Click on <font color="#B00000">Save As...</font>.</font>
<P>
A dialog box will open asking you to choose a name for your new shape. It will appear in your Clothing folder of your Inventory.
<p>
You can create as many shapes as you want, and instantly change between them just by double-clicking on their name in the Inventory box.
<P>
So far, you've only played with the Shape tab. There's a lot more you can do to your avatar on the Skin, Hair and Eyes Tabs -- and even more with the clothing tabs.
<P>
If you want, stay and play. Try the other tabs and see what you can come up with.
