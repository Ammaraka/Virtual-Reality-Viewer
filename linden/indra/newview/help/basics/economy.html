<br>
Second Life features a vibrant inworld economy that's a lot different than many other online worlds.
<P>
Every week, you'll receive a weekly stipend of ingame currency, or L$.  This amount is determined by your membership (Basic or Premium) as well as a bonus amount based on your inworld reputation (as rated by other residents).
<P>
There are many ways to make money in Second Life; generally, if it works (and is legal) in the real world, it may be possible in Second Life.  You can create objects, clothing, etc. and sell them.  If you own land, you can create any number of businesses--dance club, arcade, coffee house, chicken ranch, space station, roller coaster, etc.--and earn rewards for the time other people spend at your build.  You can even charge admission.  If you're skilled, other residents may hire you to help them with their own builds, businesses, and creations.
<P>
If you prefer not to work, or need more cash fast, you can even purchase L$ with USD$ dollars.  On the other hand, if you're rolling in the L$ dough, you can sell L$ and make real-world cash!  (See <a href="http://secondlife.com/help">http://secondlife.com/help</a> for more information.)
