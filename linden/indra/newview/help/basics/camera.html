Get a new perspective on your Second Life.
<P>

Because Second Life is 3-D, you have total and infinite control over where you place the camera (your eyes). 
<P>
Camera control is a little tricky to get the hang of, but once you do, you'll really enjoy it.
<P>
<font color="#000080">1. Hold down the ALT key to activate Focus mode.</font>
<P>
The cursor changes to a magnifying glass.
<P>
<font color="#000080">3. With ALT held down, click and release on various spots on the landscape.</font>
<P>
Notice that the view re-centers on the place where you clicked.
<P>
<font color="#000080">4. Click on your avatar and drag the mouse SLOWLY around.</font>
<P>
As you move the mouse forward and backward and side to side, the view zooms in and out and around your avatar.
<P>
<font color="#000080">5. Now hold down the ATL and CTRL keys at the same time.</font>
<p>
The cursor changes again to indicate Orbit mode.
<P>
<font color="#000080">6. With both ALT and CTRL held down, click and drag SLOWLY on the avatar again.</font>
<P>
Now, as you move the mouse, the view stays approximately the same distance from your avatar, but the camera orbits around it in all directions.
<P>
<font color="#000080">7. Now hold down ALT, CTRL, and Shift at the same time.</font>
<P>
The cursor changes to indicate Pan mode.
<P>
<font color="#000080">8. Click and drag SLOWLY on the avatar again.</font>
<P>
Now, as you move the mouse, the camera slides across the landscape. It looks like you're dragging the ground around.
<P>
<font color="#000080">9. Hit the Esc key to return to normal view.</font>
<P>
You'll also find a Camera Control panel under the View menu at the top of the screen.
<p>
Mastering camera control will take some practice. One you have a feel for it, it's not only fun, but very useful when you start to build things and need to see them from all angles.
