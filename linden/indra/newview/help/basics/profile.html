Your avatar's appearance tells people something about you (the person behind the avatar). There's also another way to let others know about yourself: your Profile.
<P>
<font color="#000080">1. Click on your avatar.</font>
<P>
<font color="#000080">2. From the pie menu, select My Profile ... </font>
<P>
Your Profile opens. It has your screen name and some checkboxes and spaces to supply informaiton about yourself. It also shows how others have rated you and how many others you have rated.
<P>
There's also a place to put an image. The image can be your (human) picture, your avatar's picture, a logo, or anything else (or nothing) that you want. To change the image, click on it. An Image Picking dialog will open and let you select from all the images at your disposal.
<P>
The information in your Profile is public. The Find feature searches through profiles to help you find others with similar interests (and others find you).
<P>
<font color="#000080">3. Take some time and tell us about yourself. You can always come back and change or add to this information later.</font>
<P>
When you're ready to move on, click Next below.
