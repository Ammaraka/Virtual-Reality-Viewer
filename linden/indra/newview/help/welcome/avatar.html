Your <font color="#006000">avatar</font> is your representative in Second Life.
<P>
It's been randomly created to get you started, but you'll be able to customize it to look almost any way you want -- and you can change it as often as you like. 
<p>
You can create and save complete outfits consisting of clothing, body shape, attachments and more, and change the total look of your avatar with a simple drag and drop.
<p>
Avatars can be male or female, and can be just about any size or shape you can imagine. Avatars can wear layers of clothes, and can have accessories -- ranging from jet packs to jewelry -- attached to a number of places.
<P>
All around your avatar is Second Life, filled with hills, valleys, trees, grass, bodies of water, buildings, all sorts of objects, and people. Don't worry, you'll be exploring it soon.
<P>
