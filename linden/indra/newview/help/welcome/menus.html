The menus along the top of the screen work like menus in most programs: <font color="#00080">Click on a menu to open it, then click on the menu item to select it.</font> 
<P>
Open each menu and look over the different menu items as you read the descriptions.
<P>
- The <font color="#006000">File</font> menu handles uploading audio clips and textures, taking screenshots and quitting.<BR>
- The <font color="#006000">Edit</font> menu lets you do the usual Edit menu tasks like cut, copy, paste and find, plus edit some Second Life specific things, like your avatar, groups and preferences. <BR>
- The <font color="#006000">View</font> menu handles what you see on your screen, and lets you display things like flying controls and your Linden Dollar account history.<BR>
- The <font color="#006000">World</font> menu creates landmarks, lets you set your home location and enables you to teleport home.<BR>
- The <font color="#006000">Tools</font> menu provides access to many of the advanced creation tools that you can use to build your own objects -- or even a home.<BR>
- The <font color="#006000">Help</font> menu lets you access this and other help screens.
