If you haven't finished your orientation yet, then <a href="welcome.html">click here</a>.
<p>
If you have finished your orientation and are now on the Second Life mainland, you're ready to explore a whole new world.
<p>
This help system will walk you through a series of topics that will build on your orientation experience and teach you everything  you need to begin your Second Life.
<p>
You don't have to plow through the whole thing in one sitting -- you can close the help system and return to it at any time. Just hit F1 or select Basic Help from the Help menu.
