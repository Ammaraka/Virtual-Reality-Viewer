The <font color="#006000">Mini Map</font> window shows you an overhead view of the part of the world near you. It will help you find people and places, as well as navigate your way around the world. 
<p>
Each <font color="#006000">Region</font> (a named area also called a "simulator") on the map is shown as a square tile, representing about 16 acres of the world.
<p>
The mini-map doesn't display the whole world -- only the nearest few Regions. (<font color="#000080">For a view of the whole world, Click on the Mini Map to view the World Map.</font>) The map moves as you move, with new regions appearing as you approach them. 
<p>
In both the Mini Map and World Map, water is shown on the map as dark blue, and the ground is green, brown or white, depending on the alitude. Gray blocks indicate buildings or other human-made structures to investigate. Your avatar always appears in the center of the Map window as a white dot, with a faint gray triangle indicating your 3D field of view. Other avatars appear as green dots. 
<p>
In the World Map, if you select a landmark with the <font color="#006000">Landmark Tracking</font> pull-down, the landmark will be shown on the map as a red dot. (If the landmark isn't within view, a red arrow will point in its direction.) Active landmarks also appear in the world as a red "beacon" that only you can see.
<p>
People on your Friends list can be displayed on the map using the <font color="#006000">Resident Tracking</font> pull-down. While you're tracking them, a red "beacon" (that only you can see) will mark their location in the world.
<p>
The World Map window can be enlarged, resized and moved. The map itself can be enlarged or shrunk within the window, with the <font color="#006000">Zoom slider</font>.
<p>
Finally, the <font color="#006000">Background</font> pull-down menu allows to set the World Map to display terrain, new places, popular places, items for sale, and available land.
