The Second Life economy is based on Linden Dollars. The economy is evolving and will continue to evolve, depending on what Second Life residents want, and what they choose to do. 
<p>
Everyone is given a basic weekly grant of Linden Dollars to spend any way they want. Residents who receive high ratings from their fellow Resident get a weekly reward. (Be nice and you make more money.)
<p>
If you want or need more than your grant, you'll need to find a way to earn more. You might start a business or, if you're skilled at architecture, clothing design, scripting or art creation, you can charge others for your time and skills. You can build an attraction and charge admission. You can give tours. You can invent other ways to earn money. Use your strengths and carve out a niche for yourself.
