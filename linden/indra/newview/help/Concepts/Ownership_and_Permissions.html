<br>
Objects can be public or owned by a particular person. When you build something, by default it is your personal property. You have the option to Deed it to a group you belong to if you want.
<p>
Ownership of personal property comes with rights, responsibilities, and costs. As the owner, you can set permissions to allow others to move, copy or delete your property -- if you wish. Otherwise nobody but you can mess with your stuff.
<p>
You can also set permissions for things you sell or give away.  You can determine whether the next owner can copy, modify, or give away your object.  Be careful when giving away original copies of your creations... once the object trades hands and the permissions are taken away, they're permanent!  You can't reset a no-modify object so you can modify it, even if you give it back to the creator.
