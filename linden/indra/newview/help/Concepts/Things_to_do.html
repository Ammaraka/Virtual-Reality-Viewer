Right now, when the world is fresh and new the main things to do in Second Life are:
<p>
- Explore
<br>- Meet others with similar (or new) interests, network, make friends
<br>- Participate in social events
<br>- Participate in deadly battles in the Jessie or Rausch combat regions
<br>- Participate in various games and contests
<br>- Create things and places others will want to explore
<br>- Experiment with scripting
<br>- Create textures and sounds out-of-world, and upload them
<br>- Collaborate with others to build something big
<br>- Start businesses that charge for products or services
<br>- Much more that we haven't even thought of yet -- but you will.
