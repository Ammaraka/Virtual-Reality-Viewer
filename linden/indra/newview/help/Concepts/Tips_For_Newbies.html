As with any society, Second Life has it's own set of cultural norms that you should be aware of so you can progress quickly while avoiding making any faux pas and causing yourself or others problems:
<p>
<font color="#B00000">1. It's OK to learn by emulation: look at other people's work, copy free textures, analyze others' scripts, etc.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">2. Don't litter! Delete your unused objects.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">3. Use physics, light, and scripted objects sparingly, they put a heavy toll on processing power and can slow the game for others.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">4. Avoid uploading copyrighted textures, graphics, characters or text. (No movie posters, pictures of Elvis, etc.) Second Life Residents favor original content.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">5. Don't build malicious objects. Guns and shooting aren't permitted in most areas. (Head to the regions Jessie or Rausch if you're looking for that sort of action.) Objects that follow other people around are cute-but annoying after a while.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">6. Use sound sparingly. Don't be the neighbor with the annoying barking dog.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">7. Know the difference between public chat and Instant Messaging. Keep private conversations private; don't copy chat and paste it somewhere else. Most of all, don't ever reveal private information (like passwords) to anyone.</font>
<p>
<font color="#B00000">8. Use your Inventory to store things you may want later. It doesn't cost anything to store things there, and it's almost unlimited in size.</font>
