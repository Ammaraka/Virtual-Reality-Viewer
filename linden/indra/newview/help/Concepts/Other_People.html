<br>
A big part of the Second Life culture is communicating and sharing with others. 
<p>
There's an open chat system for communicating with others nearby, and a built-in instant messaging system for private and group conversations. 
<p>
You can also use sounds, animations and  gestures to add to your communications.<p>
There's also a powerful search tool that lets you find other people or groups with similar interests.
