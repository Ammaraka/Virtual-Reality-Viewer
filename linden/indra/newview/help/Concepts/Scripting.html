A very powerful feature of Second Life is the ability to add a script, or small program, to an object. Scripts can turn simple objects into interactive experiences that impart information, play sounds, move or ... just about anything.
<p>
The scripting language has been designed so even non-programmers can make simple modifications and customizations. (For instance, a door may have a script so it opens with a password. It will be easy to modify the door script to the password of your choice.)
