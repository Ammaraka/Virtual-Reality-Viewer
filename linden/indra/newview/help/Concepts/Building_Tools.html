The basic tools that you will use in Second Life to build things are:<p>
- <font color="#006000">Focus</font> -- Take control of the camera to view objects from any angle.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Move</font> -- move a primitive or object around.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Edit</font> -- Move, resize, or rotate an object.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Create</font> -- Make a new primitive.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Land</font> -- Modify the land in Second Life, raising, lowering or flattening as needed to prepare it for building.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Link</font> -- connect two or more primitives into a single object.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Make Joints</font> -- connect two primitives with a moveable connection.
<p>
There are many variations and additions to these basic tools that we'll get to later on. But if you understand just these few simple tools, you've made a good start.
