Everyone is different. Everyone has their own strengths, skills and creative prowess. Some people excel in architecture. Others in scripting. Others in creating textures. Others in avatar fashion design, sound design, social design (organizing events and throwin' parties) or new areas that we haven't thought of yet.
<p>

You are a part of the creation of a new world. We value your strengths and personality, and expect them to help us grow and develop Second Life. Stretch a little, challenge yourself and learn new things from the others. But use your own strengths.
