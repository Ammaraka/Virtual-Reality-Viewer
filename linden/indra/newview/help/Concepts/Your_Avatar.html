Your avatar is your representative in Second Life.
<p>
Your avatar may be male or female, and you can customize it in almost limitless ways. 
When you see other avatars, their names will appear above their heads. When others see you, they'll see your name above your head.
<p>
You can attach things to your avatar, to make it even more original (and functional). The objects that you attach may be scripted, so they can function in different ways, for instance, jet packs for faster travel, guns for games, etc.
<p>
Your avatar has a health rating (it will appear, when needed, in the lower left corner of your screen) only while in the Damage Enabled areas where the dangerous games are played. If your health rating reaches 0%, then your avatar is (temporarily) dead, and will be teleported to your home location and healed.
