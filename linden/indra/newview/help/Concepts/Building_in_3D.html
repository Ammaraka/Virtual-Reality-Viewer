Moving around in 3D can be tricky. Building things in 3D is trickier.<p>
When you first begin to build and move things around in 3D, it's not uncommon to accidentally bury things in the ground and lose them.<p>
Yes, it's a bit more complicated than building in 2-D, but the extra flexibility and power is worth the steeper learning curve. Work through the tutorials in the Advanced Skills part of this help system and you'll catch on quickly.
