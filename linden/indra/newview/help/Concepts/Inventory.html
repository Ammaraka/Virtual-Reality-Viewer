As you spend time in Second Life, you'll gather many possessions. These may include objects, textures, sounds, items of clothing, scripts and other things. 
<p>
You can store, view and access your Inventory at any time.
<p>
By collecting and keeping things in your inventory, they'll always be handy when you need them -- and they'll be safe in case the original is deleted by accident. Also, regularly storing versions of things in your Inventory as you build is a good way to &quot;undo&quot; and go back to an earlier version of your project.
