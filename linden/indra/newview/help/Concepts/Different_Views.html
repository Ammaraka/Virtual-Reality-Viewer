There are different ways to look at the world while exploring Second Life.<p>
By default, you'll see the world in &quot;Third Person,&quot; looking over your avatar's shoulder as you control it and move it through the world. You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse to zoom closer to or farther away from your avatar. If you zoom all the way in, you'll be in Mouselook.<p>
Mouselook lets you see through your avatar's eyes, and control where you look with the mouse. It's a good way to take a quick look up, down and around. It's also a great way to do some intricate flying if you move while in Mouselook.<p>
There are times when you need more control over your view, such as when you want to closely inspect something from different angles, or when you're building something. For this kind of viewing, you can use the Focus tool to take complete control of the &quot;camera,&quot; and move it around and zoom it in and out as much as you want.
