<font color="#000000">The Second Life scripting language is very powerful. It lets you add more functionality and interactivity to everything you build.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">If you're a programmer or are familiar with other scripting languages, you'll have no trouble learning the Second Life scripting language. A complete reference to the scripting language can be found in the Help menu.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Even if you're not a programmer and you have no interest in learning to write scripts, you can still make use of them in your creations.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">If you need something complex or special scriptwise, there will be people to write it for you -- for a certain amount of Linden Dollars.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">But for simple things -- especially common ones like turning lights on and off -- there are scripts available for the taking. A number of useful scripts can be found in your Inventory.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">A good way to get scripts is to copy them from objects that already have them. As you travel through your Second Life, you'll find things that you like, some of which have scripts that you can take.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">When someone creates something, with or without a script, they can set the permissions either so people can or can't copy any or all of it. You'll no doubt find cool things that you can't copy, but many of things can be copied and you'll have access to copy the scripts, as well.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Obviously, the model lamp has exactly the script you need for your lamp. Let's take the script out, then add it to our new lamp.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The script you want is actually attached to the bulb of the model lamp. To access that single part, we'll first have to Unlink the lamp's parts.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Click on the model lamp to select it.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Open the Tools menu (the Tools menu at the top of the screen, not the Tool Palette) and select <font color="#B00000">Unlink</font>.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Click on the ground near the model lamp to unselect it, then click on the bulb.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Click on the Content tab of the Tool Palette. </font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You should see a couple of button sounds and a script called LightScript in the contents.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Drag the script into the <font color="#B00000">Scripts</font> folder of your Inventory.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Now, click on the bulb of your new lamp.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You should see an empty Contents tab in the Tool Palette.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">7. Drag LightScript from the Scripts folder of your Inventory into the Contents folder in the Tool Palette.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The script is installed. It's that simple.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">This script also plays sounds -- button clicks -- when the lamp turns on and off. So we'll also add those two sounds to the Contents folder (so the script can access them). We could have copied them from the other lamp, but since they're common sounds used by a number of things, they're already in your Inventory in the Sounds folder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">8. In your Inventory, open the Sounds folder, and drag both Button_click_down and Button_click_up into the Contents folder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">9. Close the Tool Palette to get out of Edit view.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">10. Click on the bulb of your new lamp.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The bulb should turn off.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">11. Click on it again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The bulb turns on.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">12. Hit Enter (Return) and type &quot;off&quot;, and hit Enter again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Again, the light turns off.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">13. Hit Enter (Return) and type &quot;on&quot;, and hit Enter again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">And again, the light turns on.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Next, let's take a look at a script and learn how we can easily modify it.</font>
