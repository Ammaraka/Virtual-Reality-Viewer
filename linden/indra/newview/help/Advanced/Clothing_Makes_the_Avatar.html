<font color="#000000">Soon, we'll be going out for a party. We need a new outfit for the occasion.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Click on your avatar, then click on Appearance....</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Click on the Make Outfit button at the bottom of the Appearance dialog.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Another dialog opens.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Under Folder name: type in Everyday Clothes.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You'll notice that you can choose to include your avatar's Shape, Skin, Hair and Eyes in the new outfit as well as clothes. This lets you not only instantly change clothes, but also change the entire look of your avatar any time you want.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">For now, let's only include Hair, Eyes, Shirt, Pants, Shoes, Socks and Jacket. You can always modify other things later.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Check the boxes next to Hair, Eyes, Shirt, Pants, Shoes, Socks and Jacket, then click Save.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">We have now saved the complete current outfit that we're wearing, so we can return to it instantly at any time.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Click on the Make Outfit button again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Under Folder name: type in Party Clothes and click Save.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Now, we have a duplicate set of clothes that we can modify. Let's create our new party outfit, starting with the jacket.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">7. Click on the Shirt button on the left side of the Appearance dialog.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">8. Click on the Upper Fabric square.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">A small dialog opens, displaying a swatch of the current jacket fabric.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">9. Click on the pop-up menu just below the swatch, and choose a new fabric for your jacket, then click OK.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">10. Try on a few fabrics, then choose one to keep.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">11. Choose a Fabric for the jacket's Lower Fabric.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">It can be the same as the Upper Fabric, or different, depending on your personal preference.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">12. Now play with the sliders to adjust the look and fit of the jacket.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">13. Change your shirt, pants, shoes and socks in the same way.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">14. Now, give yourself a new hairdo and a custom eye color.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">15. When you're all done modifying your outfit, click on the Save All button.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You have now saved all of the recent modifications into your Inventory.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Let's see how easy it is to change.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">16. Open the Inventory and then open the Clothing folder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">17. Drag the Everyday Clothes folder out of your Inventory and onto your avatar.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Everything should change -- even the hairstyle and eye color.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">18. Drag the Party Clothes folder out of your Inventory and onto your avatar.</font>
<p>
<font color="Black">You've instantly changed back into your party clothes, and you're ready for a night on the town.</font>
