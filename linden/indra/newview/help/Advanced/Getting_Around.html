<p>
<font color="#000000">Your Inventory will open if (it's not already open), and a new landmark, called New Landmark, is there and highlighted.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">13. Right-click on the New Landmark, and select Rename.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">14. Type in a new name for the landmark, something the describes the place, and hit Enter (Return).</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Now you have a new landmark to use any time you want.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">When you use your landmark, you'll be teleported to the nearest Telehub location.  From there, turn your avatar until you see the red beacon and follow it to the final destination.</font>
