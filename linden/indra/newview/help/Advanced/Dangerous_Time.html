<font color="#000000">Now let's visit Jessie and see how much danger we can handle.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Navigate your way to the Jessie Wall and cross over.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Once you enter Jessie, you'll notice that your health rating appears in the lower-left corner of the screen. That means your avatar can be damaged or killed here. Be careful.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000"It's good idea to be armed when travelling in Jessie, and you'll usually find a number of merchants there ready to help outfit you with weapons.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Buy a gun or other weapon.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. The use of your weapon will very from type to type -- most come with an instructional Notecard detailing proper operation. 
<p>
<font color="#000000">The most efficient way to maneuver and fire weapons is in Mouselook.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Press the M key on your keyboard to enter Mouselook mode.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">In general, you'll use the keyboard's W and S keys to move forward and backward, and use the mouse to steer. If you haven't moved around in Mouselook before, you may want to practice a little.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">One more thing you'll need to know: you also aim the gun with the mouse, and press the left mouse button to fire.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Wander around in Mouselook and take some practice shots.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Once you feel secure that you can move, aim, and shoot, head deep into Jessie.
