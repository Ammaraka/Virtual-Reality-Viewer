<font color="#000000">Let's get some furniture for your new home.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You don't need much for now, just a place for guests to sit, and maybe a lamp or two. </font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Use the World Map window to find your way to the shopping mall in Luna.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Wander around the place and find a few things that you think will go well in your new home.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Click on one of the things you want to buy, then select Buy.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">A confirmation dialog will open, giving the details of the transaction and the permissions involved. You'll notice that you are buying a copy, not the original. You'll also find out if you'll be able to modify or copy the thing you buy.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Click Buy.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">A copy of the item will be put into your Inventory.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Return to your home, and go inside.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Open your inventory. Drag your new purchases out of inventory and into your home.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">7. Click on one of the items, and select Edit from the pie menu.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">8. Drag the item around by the arrows to place it where it belongs.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Chances are, you'll also need to rotate it.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">9. In the tool panel, click on Rotate.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The arrows turn into rounded axes surrounding the item.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">10. Drag the rounded axes to rotate the item to the proper position.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">11. Place the other items you bought where you want them.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">So, now you have a party pad. How do you find people to invite over?</font>
