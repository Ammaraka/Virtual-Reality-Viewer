<font color="#000000">Before going anywhere, let's get an overview of the Second Life world, and locate a few important places.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. If the World Map window isn't open, click the Mini Map or click the Map button at the bottom of the screen to open it.</font>
<p>
The World Map window isn't static -- it changes with the world, so every change to the land, every new building and every person within your avatar's sight is on the map.
<p>
In addition, the map in the Map window can be zoomed in and out. 
<p>
The Map window can be used to track people and find landmarks, but only the names of regions are labeled.
<p>
Let's see what the World Map window can do for us.
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Find the Zoom slider at the bottom right of the World Map window.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Move and enlarge the Map window so it fills most of the screen.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Zoom the map so you can see the entire Second Life world. Left-clicking and holding on the map allows you slide the map and center in on places of interest.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Examine the map and find the following places:</font>
<p>
- <font color="#006000">Welcome Area in Ahern</font><font color="#000000"> -- this is where new residents enter Second Life</font>.<br>
- <font color="#006000">The Sandbox in Cordova</font><font color="#000000"> -- a place where any resident can freely build and experiment.  (Sandboxes are cleared twice daily; any object left behind is deleted.)<br>
- <font color="#006000">Jessie</font><font color="#000000"> -- a damage-enable area for wargaming</font>.<br>
- <font color="#006000">Busy Ben's Hoverboard Ranch in Oak Grove</font><font color="#000000"> -- A vehicle dealership with easy access to the Vehicle Recreation Area.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You can freely build in the Sandbox areas.  If you want to build something (like a home) that will stay inworld permanently, you may want to own your own land.  Be sure to check out <a href="http://secondlife.com/land/">http://secondlife.com/land/</a> for all the details behind land ownership.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">As you travel across the world in the next steps, look over the areas you cross as potential homesites.  You can use the tabs at the top of the Map to display land that has recently been marked For Sale.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Zoom the map smaller and shrink the Map window a bit, then close it.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">7. Click Next to continue.</font>
