<font color="#000000">Pretty soon, you'll want or need something that you can't find. Or maybe you'll just have an urge to make your mark in this life. Either way, you'll reach a point where you'll want to learn how to build things in Second Life.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">In this, the last of the Advanced Second Life Skills, we'll create a simple floor lamp for your home. Then we'll use scripting to turn the light on and off in a couple of ways.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">To help guide you as you build the lamp, we've put a model in your Inventory.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Go to your home, or find a nice, flat area to build your lamp.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You can build on your own land, or on public land. You can only build on someone else's land if they give you permission.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Open your Inventory.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Open the Objects folder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Open the Household folder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Find the <font color="#B00000">Floor Lamp</font>, and drag it out of your Inventory and onto the ground near you.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">As you can see, the lamp is made of three parts, each of which is a different shape: a square base, a cylindrical pole, and a half-spherical globe (the part that lights up).</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You'll also notice that the lamp isn't very beautiful -- but it's nice and simple, so it makes a good first project.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Click on the lamp's globe.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The light turns off.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">7. Click on the lamp's globe again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The light turns on.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">8. Hit Enter (Return), type &quot;off&quot; then hit Enter again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The light turns off.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">9. Hit Enter (Return), type &quot;on&quot; then hit Enter again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The light turns on.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">As you can see, the lamp is reasonably functional.</font>

<font color="#000000">Click next to begin building your own version of the lamp.</font>
