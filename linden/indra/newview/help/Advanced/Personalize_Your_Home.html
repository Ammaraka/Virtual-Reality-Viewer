<font color="#000000">Now let's personalize the cabin a little, by changing the flooring and painting the walls.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Walk into your cabin and take a look around.</font>
<p>
It's nice and quaint. But we could upgrade that floor a little.
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Make sure your Inventory is open, then open the Textures folder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Now, open the Building Materials folder, and find Spanish Tile.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Drag Spanish Tile out of your Inventory and onto the floor of your cabin.</font>
<p>
The floor is instantly converted to tile.
<p>
Now, let's do something with the walls. We could change the textures of the walls in the same way as we changed the floor, but let's try something else.
<p>
Let's keep that rough stucco-like texture, but paint a bit of a tint over it.
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Click on one of the walls of the house, and select Edit from the pie menu.</font>
<p>
Because the house is all linked so it can be easily moved around in a single piece, if you perform an editing function, like painting a wall, the whole house will be affected. So what we'll do is first select a single wall then paint it.
<p>
<font color="#000080">6. Click on Select Individual in the Tool Palette, then click on the wall you want to paint.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">7. Click on the More >> button on the tool palette to expand the palette, then click on the Texture tab in the Tool Palette, and then click on the Color box.</font>
<p>
The Color dialog opens.
<p>
<font color="#000080">8. Choose a nice, bold color -- click on an orange square on the left side of the Color dialog, then click OK.</font>
<p>
The wall keeps the stucco-like feel, but is now painted orange.
<p>
Before we continue, let's look at what we did. We changed two things: Texture and Color.
<p>
<font color="#000000">Changing texture is picking a graphic file to apply to the surface of an object. It's like applying wallpaper, but without the glue, mess or Laurel and Hardy hijinks.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Color lets you modify the texture by tinting it almost any color. If you want a solid color, then first apply the White texture, then apply the color.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">There's no cost for painting or applying textures, so you can modify your home (or other possessions) all you want without charge. (There is, however, a small, one-time fee o fL$10 to upload your own textures into the system.)</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">You can take your time now and continue to redecorate your home as much as you want by painting other walls (and the ceiling) or changing any or all of the textures.
<p>
Later, you'll be able to gather up some furniture and customize your house in other ways.</font>
