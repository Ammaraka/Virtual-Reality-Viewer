<font color="#000000">Spending time with other people is one of the joys of life. And it's just as true in your Second Life.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">So how do you find people?</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">People who you've met -- and exchanged calling cards with -- are easy to find, if they're in-world.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">1. Make sure the World Map window is open.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">2. Click on the Person Tracking pull-down menu (just above the Landmark pull-down) on the right side of the window.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">A list of people shows up. Names only show up here if they're on your Friends list, and only if that Resident is currently in-world. </font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">3. Choose a name on the list, then look at the Map.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Your friend will be shown on the map as a red circle. </font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">4. Back in the main Second Life window, fly up a ways and turn around until you see a red beacon.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">This beacon works just like the landmark beacon. You can find it and follow it to your friend. You can also click on the Teleport or Fly button in the World Map window to get to your friend more quickly.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Finding people you already know is easy. So, how do you find new friends? Use the Finder.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">5. Click the Find button at the top of your screen to open the Finder</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">The Finder helps you to locate people in Second Life, and many other things as well.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">If only our first lives were this easy.</font>
