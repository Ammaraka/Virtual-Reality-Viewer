<font color="#000080">Earning Money</font>
<font color="#000000">Second Life is an entrepreneurial world. You can create your own segment of the economy; create new goods and services that other inhabitants will be willing to pay for. Your creativity in simulated business can be as important -- and fun -- as your creativity in other aspects of Second Life.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000">Every Second Life resident receives a basic weekly Linden Dollar grant. This will be enough to explore, have fun and participate in all sorts of events and practice building objects. If you need or want more money than your grant, you'll have to find a way to earn it.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000080">Developer Incentives</font>
<font color="#000000">Second Life's best attractions, creations, and entertaining diversions are created by Second Life's Residents. Developer Incentives acknowledge these hard-working Residents with real-world cash. US Dollars are awarded monthly to the creators, designers, hosts, and bon-vivants who make Second Life more than the sum of its parts. We'll use a variety of measures and mechanisms to seek out those worthy of rewards - not just traffic. Stay tuned for additional details about this exciting development. </font>
