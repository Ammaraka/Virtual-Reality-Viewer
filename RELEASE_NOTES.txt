   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Still no sound or voice yet.

     * Login screen misleadingly displays the last grid you had
       selected even if you use the --loginuri command line option
       (IMP-29).

     * The menus for non-English languages still say "Second Life" in
       some places where they should say "Imprudence" (IMP-27).


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.0.0 RC2):

     * Rendering: Windows version ships with OpenJPEG 1.3. This fixes
       the issue of skirts and some uploaded images appearing
       half-transparent. Thanks to McCabe and everyone who helped us
       identify and test that!

     * UI: Added support for displaying a test version identifier
       (e.g. RC2) at the login screen and About Imprudence, to help
       people tell the test versions apart. (Note: you won't see it in
       this release, because this isn't a test version!) Thanks to
       McCabe for adding that!

     * UI: Rebranded the Help menu at the login screen to match the
       main Help menu (IMP-23). Thanks to Balp Allen for reporting
       that, and McCabe for fixing it!

     * UI: The "Release Notes" link in About Imprudence now takes you
       to the release notes on the Imprudence wiki, instead of to a
       bogus page on the Second Life wiki. Thanks to McCabe and Jacek
       for doing that!

     * UI: Grid selector at the login screen no longer has a duplicate
       entry (IMP-24). Thanks to Balp Allen for fixing that!

     * Misc.: Fixed the viewer stupidly creating a 'url_history.xml'
       file in 'C:\' on Windows, and perhaps in '/' (root) on Mac
       (VWR-5808). Thanks to McCabe for fixing that!

     * Code: Patched two small memory leaks when uploading scripts
       (VWR-9400). Thanks to Carjay McGinnis and Henri Beauchamp for
       making those patches!

     * Code: Patched two minor code cleanliness issues (VWR-10759,
       VWR-10837). Thanks to Aleric Inglewood for making those
       patches!

   KNOWN ISSUES

     * Some users have reported that system skirts (not attachments)
       and some uploaded images with alpha channels appear
       partially transparent all over, instead of being opaque
       in some places and transparent in others. You can fix this by
       upgrading to OpenJPEG 1.3. Future Imprudence releases will
       have the new OpenJPEG included in the regular download.

     * The grid selection list on the login screen displays a
       duplicate entry (e.g. two "SL Main Grid" entries). This is
       harmless, and a PITA to fix.

     * Still no sound or voice yet.


   CHANGES

     This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
     compared to Imprudence 1.0.0 RC1):

     * Rendering: Applied a likely fix for VWR-8920 (disappearing
       attachments when zoomed in). Please let us know in the forums
       whether this fixes the issue for you. Thanks to an unknown
       Linden for the fix, and to Strife Onizuka for pointing to it!

     * Rendering: Applied a likely fix for VWR-9358 (problems with
       palletized textures). Please
       [http://imprudenceviewer.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=66 let
       us know in the forums] whether this fixes the issue for you.
       Thanks to Angus Boyd for suggesting the fix!

     * Misc UI.: Grid selection list on the login page has been
       embraced and cleaned up. It now lists 3 options: SL Main Grid,
       SL Beta Grid, and Local OpenSim (if you run OpenSim on your
       computer). It will be made customizable in a future version.
       Thanks to Jacek for sprucing that up!

     * Misc: Fixed the debug console window always showing up. Thanks
       to McCabe for fixing it, and to an unknown Linden's testing
       code for causing it in the first place!

     * Misc: Fixed the Windows viewer crashing when clicking on
       certain links in embedded web pages (VWR-4828). Thanks
       to Nyx Linden for pointing to the updated LLMozLib!

     * Misc: Fixed the Windows installer giving an error when
       launching the viewer after installation. Thanks to McCabe for
       fixing that!

     * Misc: Imprudence now uses a separate directory from Second Life
       for storing the cache, settings, and chat logs. This fixes the
       viewer clearing the cache the first time it's run. On Linux,
       it's the '.imprudence' directory in your home directory, and on
       Mac and Windows it's the 'Imprudence' directory in your
       Application Data directory. Thanks to Jacek for doing this!

     * Misc: Fixed the Search window clearing itself out when closed
       and re-opened. Thanks to Samantha Poindexter for reporting the
       problem, to McCabe for fixing it, and to an unknown Linden's
       testing code for causing it in the first place!

     * Building: Fixed the Silver skin's Build floater not matching
       the one from the Classic skin. Thanks to Damien Fate for
       reporting the problem, and to Jacek for fixing it!

     * Code: Fixed several bits of sloppy Linden code that blocked
       compiling with gcc 4.3. Thanks to Alissa Sabre for suggesting
       the fix to VWR-9507, and Stephen Zenith for patches
       IMP-11 and IMP-12!

     * Misc UI.: Changed Group UI to use "Resident" or "Member"
       instead of "Person", for consistency (VWR-9007).
       Thanks to McCabe for sprucing that up!

   WHAT TO EXPECT

    * Many small usability improvements.

      The goal of Imprudence is to make significant usability
      improvements over the standard SL viewer, but for this first
      release our focus has simply been to get the project
      established. You'll find many small improvements scattered
      throughout the viewer, almost all of them programmed by SL
      Residents and submitted as patches to JIRA, but which LL has not
      (at least yet) accepted. Future versions of Imprudence will
      feature more significant improvements made specifically for this
      project.

    * New fonts.

      Imprudence uses different fonts than regular SL, because SL's
      fonts are proprietary and very expensive to license. The new
      fonts might make things seem "not quite right" at first, since
      your eye expects the old font you normally see in SL. We do
      think you'll enjoy the new fonts once you get used to them. (For
      the curious, the fonts used are Liberation Sans for the UI, and
      Bitstream Vera Mono for the script editor.)

    * No sound or voice.

      This release of Imprudence doesn't have any sound or voice
      support, because the software libraries SL uses for those things
      are proprietary and can't be used with open-source viewers. We
      hope to add back sound support using OpenAL for the next version
      of Imprudence. We're not sure yet when we'll be able to add
      voice back in.

    * Slightly slower texture loading.

      Textures may load slightly slower than they do in regular SL.
      Once again, this is because the texture software library SL uses
      by default (Kakadu / KDU) is proprietary, so we're using
      OpenJPEG, which is open source but not quite as speedy. The
      difference shouldn't be a major issue.


  CHANGES

    This version of Imprudence includes the following changes (as
    compared to Second Life viewer 1.21.6):

    * Building: You can now "Slice" (aka. Dimple / Profile Cut) the
      Box, Cylinder, and Prism prim types directly, without needing to
      switch to Sphere and back. (VWR-7827; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Stability: Several patches by Nicholaz Beresford to fix memory
      leaks and improve stability. (VWR-2003, VWR-2683, VWR-2685,
      VWR-3877, and VWR-3878; thanks Nicholaz!)

    * Misc.: The "Advanced" menu is now written in XUI, so you can
      edit shortcuts in that menu by editing the XML file, instead of
      needing to recompile the viewer from source. (Note: The file to
      edit is skins/default/xui/en-us/menu_viewer.xml) (VWR-2896;
      thanks Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Social: Added "Invite..." button to the Groups section of the
      Communicate panel, to make it easier to invite people to the
      selected group. (VWR-8024; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Building: Up and down arrows change Path Cut / Profile Cut by
      increments of 0.025 instead of 0.05, to make it easier to
      path-cut boxes in half, etc. (VWR-7877; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Misc. UI: Added "Return Object" to the Tools menu, to make it
      easier to return objects that are hard to right-click on.
      (VWR-1363; thanks McCabe Maxsted!)

    * Social: Added "Offer Teleport" button to the IM window.
      (VWR-2072; thanks Paul Churchill!)

    * Building: Added "Tools > Set permissions on selected task
      inventory" menu item, to set perms on multiple in-world objects
      and/or their contents. This will have a nicer UI later.
      (VWR-5082; thanks Michelle2 Zenovka!)

    * Misc. UI: Several usability and UI layout improvements to the
      land tools floater. (VWR-8430; thanks Aimee Trescothick!)

    * Misc. UI: Added "Flycam" button that appears when you are in
      flycam mode (using a joystick or SpaceNavigator); click it to
      cancel flycam mode. (VWR-8341; thanks Aimee Trescothick!)

    * Building: Rephrased "Select Texture" to the more accurate and
      descriptive phrase "Select Faces to Texture". (Inspired by
      VWR-5962; thanks McCabe Maxsted and Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Building: Increased maximum settable transparency from 90% to
      100% in the Textures tab. (Thanks Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Social: "Offer Teleport" buttons throughough the UI are now
      always clickable, even for avatars who are not on your friends
      list or who appear offline. (Thanks Jacek Antonelli!)

    * Misc.: Changed the application name, logo, login page, etc. to
      Imprudence.

    * Misc.: Imprudence has its own version numbers, starting at
      1.0.0. Use "Help > About Imprudence" to check the SL source
      version it's based on.

    * Misc.: Disabled FMOD, KDU, and Vivox (SLVoice) proprietary
      software.

    * Misc.: Changed fonts to Liberation Sans and Bitstream Vera Mono.


   KNOWN ISSUES

    * Windows: At the end of the installer, if you leave the "Launch
      Imprudence Viewer" checkbox enabled and press "Finish", you will
      receive an error message and it will not automatically start the
      viewer. But this does not harm anything, and starting the viewer
      yourself (e.g. from the desktop shortcut) should work fine.

    * Windows: When the viewer is started, a text console window will
      appear displaying debug information, and then be covered by the
      main viewer window. This will be disabled in future releases.
      You can disable it manually by opening "Advanced > Debug
      Settings" and changing "ShowConsoleWindow" to false, then
      restarting the viewer.

    * Windows: The viewer may crash when clicking links in embedded
      web pages, including certain sections of the Search window and
      the "Web" section of avatar profiles. We hope to fix this in the
      future. To work around it for now, just avoid clicking on links
      in embedded web pages in the viewer.

    * All Platforms: The viewer may be (very) slow to start the first
      time, as it clears the cache.

    * All Platforms: When using the Silver skin, the Tools (aka Build)
      floater doesn't have the new features (e.g. transparency up to
      100%, smaller path cut increment), and improperly displays the
      land tools brush size combo box on every build tab.
