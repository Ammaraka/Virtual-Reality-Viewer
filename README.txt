  
 ABOUT THE SECOND LIFE VIEWER SOURCE ARCHIVE PROJECT

   This project is a community-maintained archive of Second Life 
   viewer source code releases. For more information about the 
   project, see:  

     http://github.com/jacek/sl-viewer-source-archive/
  
  
 PURPOSE
 
   The purpose of the archive is to provide a base for viewer
   forks or patch development and a convenient method for viewing
   and merging the diffs between releases via the Git version
   control system.
  
  
 CONTENTS
  
   The archive contains the full source code for every official,
   versioned release and release candidate of the Second Life
   viewer since January 2007, when the viewer code was first
   released.

   The archive does not contain the source for betas, "First
   Look" viewers, dated snapshots, or development branches,
   because it is infeasible to deduce their ancestral
   relationship to other versions.

   The archive also does not contain the viewer artwork or
   required libraries, for space and licensing reasons.

   As of this writing, these other resources (as well as all
   code contained in the archive) are available for download
   from Linden Research, Inc.:
